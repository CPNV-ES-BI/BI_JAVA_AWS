Here is an explanation of the purpose of folders and files in the directory structure:

## Files at the root of the project

- `.gitattributes`: Specifies attributes for files in a Git repository. It is used to tell Git how to treat
  certain files and can be used to set things like text encoding or end-of-line characters.
- `.gitignore`: Lists patterns for files and directories that Git should ignore when adding files to the
  repository or when checking for changes.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define
  the services that make up your application and how they should be deployed and run.
- `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`: The file you are reading right now. It contains the folder structure of the project.
- `LICENSE.md`: Likely contains information about the license under which the project is released.
- `GNUmakefile`: Is used to define commands that can be run from the command line to automate tasks. It is
  typically used to build and test software projects, but can be used for any kind of automation.
- `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`: These files are used to run Maven commands from the command line. `mvnw` is for Unix-based
  systems, while `mvnw.cmd` is for Windows. It allows you to run Maven commands without having to install it.
- `pom.xml`: This is the project object model (POM) file for the Maven project. It contains information about the
  project, such as its dependencies, build configuration, and plugins.
- `README.md`: Likely contains information about the project, including how to build and run it.

## Folders and files inside them

- `.github`: Contains files related to GitHub, such as workflow configuration files.
- `.mvn/wrapper`: Contains files used to run Maven commands from the command line, specifically
  the `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` scripts.
- `doc`: Contains documentation for the project, such as class documentation generated by Javadoc and
  sequence diagrams.
  - `classes`: Contains class diagrams images and the PlantUML source files used to generate them.
  - `sequences`: Contains sequence diagram images and the PlantUML source files used to generate them.
- `docker`: Contains files related to Docker, such as a `Dockerfile` used to build a Docker image for the
  project.
  - `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions for building a Docker image for the project.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the project. It is divided into `main` and `test` directories for
  production code and test code, respectively.
  - `main/java`: Contains the source code for the project.
    - `com/example/bijavaaws`: Package containing the source code for the project.
      - `BIJavaAWS.java`: The main class for the project.
      - `config`: Contains configuration classes for the project.
        - `AwsConfiguration.java`: Contains configuration for the AWS SDK.
      - `dataobject`: Contains classes related to data objects.
        - `DataObject.java`: The data object interface.
        - `DataObjectImpl.java`: The implementation of the `DataObject` interface.
      - `exceptions`: Contains custom exceptions for the project.
        - `ObjectAlreadyExistsException.java`: Thrown when an object already exists in the data store.
        - `ObjectNotFoundException.java`: Thrown when an object is not found in the data store.
  - `main/resources`: Contains non-code resources for the project, such as configuration files.
    - `application.properties`: Contains configuration for the project.
    - `aws.example.properties`: Contains example configuration for the AWS SDK.
  - `test/java`: Contains the test code for the project.
    - `com/example/bijavaaws`: Package containing the test code for the project.
      - `BIJavaAWSTests.java`: Contains tests for the main class for the project.
      - `dataobject`: Contains tests for the classes related to data objects.
        - `DataObjectImplTest.java`: Contains tests for the `DataObjectImpl` class.
    - `test/resources`: Contains non-code resources for the test code, such as test data files.
      - `test-file.txt`: A test data file.
